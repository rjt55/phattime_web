            <h2>Boar Luring 101</h2>
            <p>In order to successfully lure and kill a boar for its sustenance we must first have roughly 6 available villagers.</p>
            <p>While 5 of the villagers are slaughtering lamb by your town center, take one of them to a known boar location.</p>
            <p>Shoot two arrows at the boar and run your villager the hell back to your town center, less you allow it to be mauled to death.</p>
            <p>As the boar approaches the town center where the other villagers are, they should stop what they are doing and fire arrows and kill the boar.</p>
            <p>You may need to garrison the villager used to lure the board, less again, it may be mauled the death.</p>
            <p>Once the boar is killed ungarrison the villager and have all of them pick the boar clean for its juicy meat.</p>
